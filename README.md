In this very project by Evan Nguyen and Smit Patel;

- The entire E-R diagram and its conversion into a Relational Database after going through the requirements was done.
- With a crypto named PPS, various functionalities were added to this primarily 'a database web application', where each user could buy PPS from the root user, sell it back, transfer the PPS to other users of their choice. 
- With all the operations, taking place various changes such as increase and decrease in the price of PPS, reduction and addition of balance of PPS in different users' accounts, changes in their balance of money, withdrawing and depositing of money from to the respective users' accounts etc. would take place. 
- ALL of these was translated into the Database tables with the help of various SQL queries.
- We also implemented various features such as the ones in which 10 latest transfers of PPS, few of the latest money deposits, withdrawals etc. would be shown.
